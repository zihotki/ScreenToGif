After opening a default screen should be present with buttons - Start recording and Options

Options screen should incorporate all file save options and configuration.

Editor needs to be trimmed down so that there will be less toolbars as well as buttons available. 
Main goal of the editor is to cut extra frames in the beginning and at the end.

The workflow (after setup is done) will be:
1. Run the app
2. switch to youtube
3. press hotkeys to start recording
4. Recording window pops-out to foreground maintaining the focus to original window
5. press hotkey to stop recording
6. the app will also send 'SPACE' key to window in focus so that play back will be paused
7. an editor will open and focus will go to it
8. adjustments can be done for the animation in the editor
9. 'CTRL+S' pressed, save operation is run in background. Encoder window will remain hidden and can be opened via menu in the tray.
The editor will be closed.
10. Recording window will open in foreground but the focus will go to original window (optional, we can use global hotkeys to start new one)


Tasks:

1. Move save options to config window - Done
2. Remove redundant toolbar buttons - Done
3. Make application runnable - Done
4. Polish settings window
5. Embed save progress into the Editor
